# LR-HR-dataset

This repository contains satellite image patches from two different sources: Low Resolution (LR) Sentinel-2 patches and High Resolution (HR) PlanetScope patches focusing on the YarHussain region in the Swabi District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Both sets of patches are provided as TIF files, each with a shape of 333x333x3. The Sentinel-2 patches represent lower resolution satellite imagery, while the PlanetScope patches offer higher resolution data. These image patches, each consisting of 333x333 pixels with 3 channels, are suitable for various remote sensing applications, such as super-resolution studies, land cover classification, or other geospatial analyses.
